# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Introduction
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other relevant 84 features. The model employs a Decision Tree Regressor (DTR), a supervised machine learning algorithm, to analyze patterns in the dataset and provide accurate predictions.

## Project Workflow:
### 1. Data Collection:
Collect a dataset containing house features and corresponding prices.
Example: Datasets can be sourced from Kaggle, public repositories, or real estate APIs.
### 2. Data Preprocessing:
Handling Missing Values: Fill or remove missing data to ensure the dataset is complete.
Feature Engineering:
Convert categorical variables (e.g., city, neighbourhood) into numerical data using encoding techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Scale numerical features for better model performance.
Data Splitting:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets, typically in a ratio of 80:20.
### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze relationships between house features and price using visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, box plots).
Identify outliers and correlations to guide feature selection.
### 4. Model Implementation:
Algorithm Selection:
Use Decision Tree Regression due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and its interpretability.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Optimize parameters like max_depth, min_samples_split, and min_samples_leaf using techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search.
### 5. Model Training:
Train the Decision Tree Regressor on the training data.
Use the features as input and the house prices as output labels.
### 6. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics such as:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
RÂ² Score
If needed, compare the DTR's performance with other regression models (e.g., linear regression, or Random Forest Regression).
### 7. Deployment (Future Work):
Create an API or web application to take house feature inputs and output predicted prices.
Tools for deployment: Flask, Django, or FastAPI for backend development.

## Advantages of Decision Tree Regression:
Non-Linear Relationships: Captures complex, non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.
Interpretability: Decision Trees clearly represent how predictions are made through their branching structure.
No Need for Scaling: DTR does not require feature scaling (e.g., standardization or normalization).
