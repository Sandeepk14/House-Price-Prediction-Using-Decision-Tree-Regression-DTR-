# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Decision-Tree-Regression-DTR-
The objective of this project is to predict the prices of houses based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other relevant factors. The model employs a Decision Tree Regressor (DTR), a supervised machine learning algorithm, to analyze patterns in the dataset and provide accurate predictions.
